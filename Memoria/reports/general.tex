\hspace{1.5em}\textbf{Operating System: }All languages were tested on a laptop running Ubuntu Mate 16.04 (amd64).\\

\textbf{Compilation: }All implementations (except Python's) come with a Makefile to make compilation and execution easier. In the case of Python, a README with instructions to run the example program is provided.\\ % TODO aclarar temas de make clean y demás

\textbf{Iterative/Recursive versions: }In order to change between iterative and recursive implementations of functions, just navigate to the wrapper function (for example, \texttt{searchKey}), comment the current version and uncomment the other one.\\

\textbf{Example programs: }If you want to change the example programs, please remember that most Pascal's functions fail whenever an uninitialized tree is passed as an argument, so the other implementations will fail as well. Make sure you always use a properly initialized tree when you are testing the behaviour of the other functions.
